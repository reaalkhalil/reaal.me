Hi, I'm Reaal Khalil. And this is the website where I share things; actually, it's more than that, it's also a digital journal. I keep track of some things here, so it's as much for me as it is for you. I've always found it difficult to maintain a blog, I'd much rather be doing things than writing about them. But the more I do and the more I learn, the more I feel the need to document, so I can look back and see how far I've gone and try to figure out where I'm going.

I'm currently doing a masters in Physics at Oxford Uni, I like Physics, it's cool. I'm also very interested in coding, all sorts; web design and development have been paticularly good for me so far. Machine Learning is another of my interests, not sure which I prefer: implementation or theory.

Now go have a look around my website, click on things or whatever. And excuse any pixelated pictures and videos, as some of the older posts on here are from very long ago and I had a very bad camera phone as a child.
