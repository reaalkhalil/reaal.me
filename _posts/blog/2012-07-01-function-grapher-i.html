<p>This function grapher supports complex numbers in the following manner: its domain is the set of real numbers while its range includes both real numbers and imaginary numbers. It also supports functions of both the variable x and time, to use this feature simply type the letter 't' to represent the time variable. The input box in the grapher is the function such that the variable y is equated to the contents of the input box. So there's no need to type 'y=' inside the input box. The 100% represents the zoom level, and the left-most quantity represents the quality of the graph. As the number increases the graph decreases in quality. The blue lines in the graph represent the real components of the function, while the red lines represent the complex component.</p>
