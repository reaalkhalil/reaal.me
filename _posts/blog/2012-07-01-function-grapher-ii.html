<p>This function grapher supports complex numbers differently than its predecessor: both its domain and range include the set of complex numbers. Here the function is in terms of 'z', the complex variable. This grapher also supports functions of both time and 'z', but be sure to lower the quality of the graph (by increasing the number in the left-most input box or by clicking the jagged curve) so it doesn't use up too much processing power. If you are not familiar with this sort of graph, then let me acquaint you with the notion of the colors: The hue represents the argument of the complex number ( red:0, green:π/2, cyan:π, violet:3π/2), and the shade (amount of black or white) represents the modulus. White represents a modulus of zero while and it gets darker as the number increases.<object width="660" height="495" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/complex1.swf" /><param name="menu" value="false" /><embed width="660" height="495" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/complex1.swf" menu="false" /></object></p>
