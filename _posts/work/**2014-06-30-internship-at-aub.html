<p>Woah it's been such a long time since I blogged, it's 11:57AM right now and I'm waiting for Dr. Ghassan Antar to finish his physics class which ends at 12:15. I've somehow managed to get myself an internship at AUB with him, making a MATLAB script which does stuff related to biophysics (UGHHHHH). Don't get me wrong I don't hate MATLAB, it's an essential tool in experimental sciences and it makes life easier. But.. does it have to be me?! Yep I'm going into nag mode, This code is just not working!!! D: And it's not like We're working on some cool research project, he just wanted me to write this cuz he thought it'd be fun. Anyhow, I met Dr. Antar last Tuesday, very nice guy. He told me what I was supposed to do and gave me some relevant files and a report. I was to start today, and I think I'm done already...</p>
<p>Well, these figures look good enough.. right? I mean I've no clue what I'm doing :S</p>

<p>The code is supposed to fit ellipses onto the contours of images, which are ideally microscopic photos of bacteria or cells or other biological squishy things.</p>
<p>And that's it I guess..</p>
